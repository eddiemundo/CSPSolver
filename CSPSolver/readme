A constraint satisfaction problem solver. It is designed to solve problems
involving a finite number of variables, each with finite integer domains. It
solves these problems using contraints in the form of propagators, and search.
To understand the "theory" behind this solver check out Guido Tack's
dissertation "Constraint Propagation - Models, Techniques, Implementation"
