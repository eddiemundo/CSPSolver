General outline of CSPSolver

To run the solver we first have to set up a variable store, a propagator queue
and propagators and the dependencies between the propagators and the variables
they care about.

A variable store is a dictionary mapping variable names to VariableDomains. It
essentially represents the domain of the problem.
- VariableDomains contain the lower and upper bound of the variable as well as
some other information like whether a variable domain is empty (failed) or
assigned (contains exactly 1 value). The also fire events representing how they
are changed and schedule propagators based on these events. In order to
schedule these propagators the VariableDomains contain dependency information
regarding the propagators. The dependency information are things like when
a certain propagator should be scheduled (maybe the propagator depends only
on whether the upper bound of the variable changes) 
 
A propagator queue is a queue that contains propagators to be run on the
current variable store. Propagators are added to this queue by VariableDomains
when they are changed.

The solver function itself takes a variable store, runs the propagators (which
have access to this store), after the propagators have pruned the domain as
much as they can, the solver splits the domain, and recursively runs itself
on these split domains.
